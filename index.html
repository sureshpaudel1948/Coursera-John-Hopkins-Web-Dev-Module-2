                <p>Education is that lowest part of 'ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE' under
                    which we know, see and gain any thing or position in between
                    the world or the Universe or Bramhand and the body. This is
                    'by the senses and of the senses' of the body. All such
                    education-based achievements are upto the body only.
                    Education is also called Shiksha in Sanskrit. Education is
                    described as the means through which individuals come to
                    understand, perceive, or attain things. It implies that
                    education is the process through which we gain knowledge and
                    insight into the world around us.</p>

                <p>Self Realization is the second system under
                    'ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE' under which we know, see and gain any
                    thing and the position of Self. Self Realization is based on
                    'by the Self, for the Self and of the Self'. Self
                    Realization is secondly called 'Swaddhyaya' in Sanskrit
                    which means 'the study of the Self. Self Realization is also
                    portrayed as a means to understand one's own position or
                    nature. This goes beyond just acquiring knowledge about
                    external things; it involves gaining deep insight into the
                    self, one's identity, and one's place in the world.</p>

                <h2 id="spirit">Spiritualization</h2>
                <p>The System under which we know, see and gain any thing or
                    position of the Soul is Yoga or Spiritualization. This is
                    based on 'by the Soul, for the Soul and of the Soul. The
                    Soul is not Perfect, hence Liberation and Immortality (Mukti
                    and Amartaa) are not achieved under this system.
                    Spiritualization is also known as 'Addhyatma' which means 'towards
                    Aatma. Yoga or Spiritualization is inherently soul-centric.
                    It is a process that is initiated, conducted, and oriented
                    toward the soul itself. This highlights the deeply
                    introspective and self-reflective nature of spiritual
                    practices.</p>
